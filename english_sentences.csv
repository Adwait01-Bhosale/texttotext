"The SMS concept was developed in the Franco-German GSM cooperation in 1984 by Friedhelm Hillebrand and Bernard Ghillebaert.[6] The innovation in SMS is Short. The GSM is optimized for telephony, since this was identified as its main application. The key idea for SMS was to use this telephony-optimized system, and to transport messages on the signaling paths needed to control the telephony traffic during time periods when no signaling traffic existed. In this way, unused resources in the system could be used to transport messages at minimal cost. However, it was necessary to limit the length of the messages to 128 bytes (later improved to 140 bytes, or 160 seven-bit characters) so that the messages could fit into the existing signaling formats.This concept allowed SMS to be implemented in every mobile station by updating its software. This concept was instrumental for the implementation of SMS in every mobile station ever produced and in every network from early days. Hence, a large base of SMS capable terminals and networks existed when the users began to utilize the SMS.[7] A new network element required was a specialized short message service center, and enhancements were required to the radio capacity and network transport infrastructure to accommodate growing SMS traffic."

"For example, in Jamaica, a AT&T customer opted for an international service. Additional payment of 65 per minute can be made, whereas a B-Mobile (Jamaica) customer has to pay for an equivalent international service /bin/sh.20 for every minute. Some service providers focus on international sales, whereas some others on regional sales. For example, The National Phone Company of Jamaica, Cable and Wireless (C&W) Company's position is that the same B-phone customers spend less on local calls and more on international calls. This difference is mainly because of the currency conversion, because SIM card is purchased in local currency. In America, there is no competition for such services because some prominent service providers do not offer settle-when-you-quit service.

"The emission temperature of infrared radiation depends on the intensity, from the upper layers of the atmosphere longwave radiation is emitted, and from the lower layers, this is less. Most of the radiation emitted from the upper layers goes into the space, whereas the radiation from the lower layers enters the atmosphere again and gets absorbed by it. In this way, the green house effect depends on the rate of decrease of temperature with the height. If the temperature decrease rate is less green house effect is less and vice versa. Theories and models both indicate that due to the worming effect, the decrease in temperature as we go up is reduced. A negative lapse rate feedback is produced and this makes the green house effect weak. Calculation of the rate of change of temperature with height is very subtle and sensitive to tiny changes, and so it is very difficult to find out whether the model represents the reality or not."

Among all the sex positions in the class of standing posture, this occupies the highest place in the intensity of sexual desire. In this position, the woman stands erect and spreads her legs, and the man begins to enter her from the front or from the behind. For penetration from the behind, initially the woman stands erect, and from near the waist bends a bit forward, so that the buttocks spread outwards, and bending her knees she bends down, in this process she takes out her buttocks outwards, and due to this the cunt is partly seen. Thereafter, the man performs penetration. During the sexual game in this position, the man can hold the hands or the waist of the woman and can increase the speed of his thursts. This position offers both the partners the scope to access the other's body better. There is only one drawback of this position, in that it makes the secret organs of both the partners fall in line naturally...If people so wish, they can make some modification in the base posture of this position."
